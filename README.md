# Wizard's Castle
> A remake of the 1980 Exidy Sorcerer game written by JOSEPH R. POWER  

## Original project

Forked from: [Wizards-Castle-40th-Anniversary-CSharp-Edition](https://github.com/yourwishismine/Wizards-Castle-40th-Anniversary-CSharp-Edition.git)

Copy I was working from is found in [PreFork](./PreFork)

## Refactor

When I saw this code, I started compulsively refactoring it.  That's, also, a kind of game.  So, I forked to save my progress in the game.
